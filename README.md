üìå**Tasks:**

**1.** **Matrix Visualization:** Construct a matrix to display the percentage contribution of each category to the total sales. This will provide insights into each category's relative performance within overall sales. (total sales = SUM(sale_amount)). The total_sales column values shouldn‚Äôt change when a filter like category or brand is applied.

**2.** **Card Visualization:** Create a card visual to showcase sales by category. Configure this to respond only to category-specific filters applied to the sales table, ensuring it remains unaffected by other types of filters.
